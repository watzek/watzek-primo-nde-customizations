## Library Cards customization

Displays a card for each of the two Lewis and Clark Libraries on the Primo NDE home page. Also queries LibCal for current day's library hours for each.

Normally one would edit [assets/homepage/homepage_en.html](https://github.com/watzek/watzek-primo-nde-customizations/blob/main/assets/homepage/homepage_en.html), but it seems like this customization was necessary to inject dynamic content (library hours).
